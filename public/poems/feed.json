      "summary": "DELAYED till she had ceased to know, Delayed till in its vest of snow Her loving bosom lay. An hour behind the fleeting breath, Later by just an hour than death,— Oh, lagging yesterday! Could she have guessed that it would be; Could but a crier of the glee Have climbed the distant hill; Had not the bliss so slow a pace,— Who knows but this surrendered face Were undefeated still?",

La que se alza en mis versos no es tu voz: es mi voz porque tú eres ropaje y la esencia soy yo; y el más profundo abismo se tiende entre las dos. Tú eres fria muñeca de mentira social, y yo, viril destello de la humana verdad.",

O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. O Captain! my Captain!",
