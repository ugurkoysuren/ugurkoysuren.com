      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note This version of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass was adapted from The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass. The Guttenberg file does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and therefore should not be taken too seriously as an edition.</description>
